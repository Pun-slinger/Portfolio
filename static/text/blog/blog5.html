    Steps of making a film are:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Outline your idea</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Write out your script</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Storyboard each shot in the film</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Decide what you need for each scene</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Determine the setting of the scene</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Determine what props, make-up costumes, etc. will be used</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Complete principle photography</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Edit the film and assemble the clips</b>
        </li>
    </ol>

    ... which can also be divided into 3 main segments:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Pre-production</b>: Includes everything required to plan the film and
            any arrangements that need to be made prior to
            firing up the camera(s). Those typically are:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Visiting locations and get permission for filmming
                </li>
                <li>
                    Script writing
                </li>
                <li>
                    Storyboard
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Production</b>: The process of obtaining, practicing techniques, stablize, and firing up the camera as well as the lightings and capture proper audio.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Post-production</b>: Consist of editing the shots filmed into a movie that tell a meaningful story.
        </li>
    </ul>
