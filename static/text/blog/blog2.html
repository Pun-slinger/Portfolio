    An image is defined as a <b>visual representation of something</b>. An image is usually used to explain text
    content that should be used sparingly in order to
    enhance or expand ono the content while adding visual interest to the web page. By adding graphics like tables,
    pie charts, infographics, or simply a photo,
    you can help users to understand your content better when alone is unable to convey a clear idea.

    For example, you're having a presentation about photography and at some point, you went into ways of improving
    your photos like Rule of Thirds and explains to others all about it.
    However, if no images was used, the audience would have absolutely no idea how an image with Rule of Thirds
    would look like nor be convinced that Rule of Thirds would improve a photo.
    On the other hand, if an image was used like below, said image would give a visual explaination to the topic,
    made it easier for the audience understand the concept.

    The above was one of many ways of using images to their best effect in creating multimedia content. Another way
    is too avoid meaningless images. Do not add images in your content
    for the purpose of just having images included in your content or to "spice up" your content.

<img id="img-distract" style="width: 75%;">

    As shown here is not how you should add images to your content for the sake having a background. It creates distraction for the users/viewer from your multimedia content.

    Now you know how you should use images for creating multimedia content, you should also know that there are 2 types of images and knowing how these types works will allow you
    to use images more effectively in the process of creating.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Bitmap:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A simple matrix or grid of dots and color information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Produce good quality images where shading and detail are needed, meaning they're best suitable for realistic photos or images that required high level of details
                </li>
                <li>
                    Higher detail also means bitmap required more memory space and bigger file size.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Vector:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Made up of objects such as straight lines, curves or shapes, and each portion of the image is represented mathematically.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Because vector images is made of lines and shapes, they're more suitable for multimedia content that involved 3d animations, graphic shapes, etc... like cartoons and symbols.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Portion of image is represented mathematically means vector images are able to be zoomed in, scaled, and resized, something bitmap is unable to do and results in decrease in quality.
                </li>
                <img id="img-zoom" style="width: 25%;">
                <li>
                    Smaller file size, perfect for web content that require less downloading time and faster render.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
