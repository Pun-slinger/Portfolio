    is made up of, all of them could be boils down to 6 key principle:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Availability</b>: How easy it is to access your website, if users try to access your website and it doesn't work or just having a hard time accessing, your users will become frustrated and you'll lose valuable customers.

        <li><b>Clarity & Effeciency</b>: A website need to have a clear and usable design. A website with clarity and simplicity helps users finish their tasks as quickly as possible with the least time looking around. Failing to do so will lead to your users wasting a huge chunk of their time finding what they came for, or they might forget their initial goal and leave your site feeling dissatisfied.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Learnability</b>: This describe the learning and recognizing process the user goes through when they first encounter your website, how easy it is for your users to familiarize themself with your website's design. In order to keep the learning curve for your users as short as possible, your goal is to design interfaces that don't require instructions or a long process of figuring out your site by creating something that's easy to learn or something most people already know. An example would be navigating back to your homepage, the majority of users would be looking for a logo at the top left corner. If your website works different, users will spend more time learning how to get back to your homepage.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Credibility</b>: As scam become more and more common these days, this become even more crucial for a website. Even if people find the content they are looking for on your website, if they donâ€™t trust it, your website and content is virtually useless. One way of ease the skepticism of users is to be transparent about you and your business by providing them with an "About us" page or section with your contact information.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Relevancy</b>: A beautiful, innovative, and effective website can be render absolutely useless if its content is completely irrelevant. You need to create relevant content by determining your target audience, their needs, and cater to them. The more relevant your content to your users, the more user-friendly and engaging your website is.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li><b>Satisfaction</b>: At the end of the day, your main question when it comes to your own website is how pleasant is it to use your website. The more checkboxes on the web usability list you tick, the better the experience for your users.
        </li>
