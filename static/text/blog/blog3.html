<p>Audio from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHIwlRjJbd8" target="_blank"> Murray Gold - Topic</a>.</p>

    Do you hear anything upon selecting this blog ? That is sound, waves of pressure created by the vibrations in the
    air,
    but more specifically that is digital audio, which is the representation of sound in digital form. As nice as the
    music may be,
    notice how the music immediately play upon selecting this blog ? This, unfortunately is not how you should use audio
    in web design nor in any multimedia.

    Sound waves is consist of amplitude and frequency, both of which when vary will creates different sounds. The
    amplitude controls the loudness of the sounds while
    the frequency controls the pitch of the sound. Unlike images, humans are more sensitive to sounds. A person can
    normal hear sound frequencies between 20Hz to 20000Hz,
    any lower or higher than those numbers and the sound would be out of the human hearing range. Similiarly, humans can
    hear sounds with loudness starting at 0 dB, with
    being 85dB and higher can be dangerous to hearing. (I would included those kind of sounds for demostration purposes
    but it would not be wise)

    Like images, sound and audio also helped to expand the content and enhance the user's experience with the content.
    And like images,
    sound and audio can have a detrimental effect towards the content of the multimedia if not used correctly, or even
    worse, can actually
    harm the users themselves. Fortunately, there are many ways to use sound and audio correctly so that your webpage or
    multimedia content
    will benefit from it.

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Avoid playing sound automatically</b>: As mentioned above, autoplaying music is a bad practice. Unexpected noise on a webpage can be startling or distracting, the
        users should be the one to control audio playback, like the audio controlled I placed at the top of this blog post.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Underestimate the audio level</b>: Users typically are most irritated by loud sounds than silent audio.
        Always assume users is having max volume on their machine
        and set the volume of your audio accordingly. It's better to underestimate than to destroy your users' eardrums.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Use high quality audio</b>: Use high quality audio if possible. Audio with grainy sounds or static might ruin
        the listeners experience. This also apply to recording or creating audio,
        use high quality equipments, recording software, minimize background audio, and speak clearly for voice
        recordings. Avoid using low quality audio unless you are trying to make a point or demonstration.
    </li>

    <li>
        Non-speech sound effects can add an extra dimension to multimedia content, but these should be have to be quiet
        and nonintrusive or can be startling. User should also have the option to
        turn them off.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>For hearing impaired users</b>: Provide caption or subtitles, not only that you will be helping your users
        but they might recommend your content to others out of thankfulness.
    </li>
</ul>
